 **GameBuilder Plus** is a community
 driven repository of useful Cards, Scripts, Docs, Assets 
 and anything that we find useful when working with [GameBuilder](http://gamebuilder.area120.com/).

> This document and repository is work in progress. Many things here are placeholders.

# Structure

* `assets` – textures, images, models and anything that can be useful. 
  All assets must be compatible with [CC BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
* `cards` – ready-made cards. 
* `docs` – documentation about various things about GameBuilder not found in official docs.
* `scripts` – scripts, utilities, snippets and other useful JS code that can be copy/pasted into cards.
* `tools` – various tools that are useful for working with GameBuilder, 
  such as map generators, texture processing, card repackaging and so on. 
  Tools must not require complex machine setup! For now this is Java/Kotlin, Python, .NET and JavaScript.   
* `gamebuilder` – git-ignored folder that you can use to link to GameBuilder content. 
  You can add a symbolic link to `Resources/Data/StreamingAssets/BehaviorLibrary` in GameBuilder installation folder, for example.
